## Can I come along?

## Where do you meet?
 
Usually in the Adelaide CBD, at whoever's office is kind enough to let some geeks hang out in their meeting rooms after hours. For specifics [contact us](/page/contact).

## <a name=saferspaces></a>Our safer spaces policy

### Code of conduct

public_sectR is a space for learning and sharing our professional skills in R. To maintain public_sectR spaces as safe and welcoming we have standards of behaviour that we expect and that are enforced. Everyone who attends our events online and in person agrees to make the event a harassment-free conference experience for everyone.

One aspect of behaviour that is particularly important to us is the potential for workplace power hierarchies to flow into public_sectR events and so silence more junior staff while promoting the voices of senior staff. Because of this we ask that if you have management reposonsibility, you consider the power that comes with that position and if you decide to come to an event then to take active steps to listen and appreciate the work of those at more junior levels of the public sector hierarchy.

### Practicalities

If you are harased or believe that someone else has been harrased at a public_sectR event please contact one of the founders:

Kristen Osborne: [kristen.osb@gmail.com)(kristen.osb@gmail.com)

Mel Heap:

Owen Churches: [ofchurches@gmail.com](ofchurches@gmail.com)

The founders will lookseriously and prompty at the case. If one of the founders is the person doing the harasing, that person will recuse themselves from the matter. The founders will respond as promptly as they can. Harasers will be asked to stop the harmful behaviour imediately. Beyond this, the founders may take any action they deem appropriate including but not limited to banning harasers from future public_sectR events and identifying the harasser to other organisaions or the public.
